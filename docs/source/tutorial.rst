Using PyCardano
---------------

Create a payment key and a payment address::

    >>> from pycardano import Address, Network, PaymentSigningKey, PaymentVerificationKey

    >>> payment_signing_key = PaymentSigningKey.generate()
    >>> payment_signing_key.save("payment.skey")
    >>> payment_verification_key = PaymentVerificationKey.from_signing_key(payment_signing_key)
    >>> payment_verification_key.save("payment.vkey")

    >>> network = Network.TESTNET
    >>> address = Address(payment_part=payment_verification_key.hash(), network=network)
    >>> address
    'addr_test1vr2p8st5t5cxqglyjky7vk98k7jtfhdpvhl4e97cezuhn0cqcexl7'


.. warning::

   Your address generated by the python code above will be different from the one shown.
   Please use the address you generated. Anything sent to the address above will be lost.


Fund the address with some tADA (test ADA) through the
`faucet <https://testnets.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/tools/faucet/>`_ here.

With the address and key created above, you can now create and sign transactions, and submit the
transaction to Cardano network. `Transaction usage guide <guides/transaction.html>`_ provides detailed steps about
transaction creation and signing.
